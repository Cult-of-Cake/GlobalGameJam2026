G1: A Feltweaver... Do you seek the Sock Snake Mask?
M: Hello! Are you its guardian?
G1: Indeed. I am Crewel of the Dye-Stick Meadow.
G1: I've guarded this mask for a long time, waiting for a Feltweaver to appear if this world is in trouble.
G1: And it's certainly in trouble now. But you have survived long enough to proceed this far...
G1: I grant you the Sock Snake Mask. With that, you can fight the creatures that have seized upon this land in its vulnerable state.
