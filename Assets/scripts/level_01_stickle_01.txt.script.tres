P: You're a Feltweaver, right?
M: Uh-huh. I'm Merino. I was called out of my sock den because this world was in trouble.
P: We sure could use the help. I hear there's a Mask of Creativity somewhere in this area.
P: Levels in Craftskan are measured by the metre roll, and each of them have different environments to explore.
P: Watch out for Munchy Mice, though! They got into the fabric bin when we were put away, and they'll try to eat you along with the world.
M: Don't worry! All I have to do is find the mask's guardian, right?
P: If you can talk them into giving it to you.
M: Then I'll do my best!
P: Head out east from here. It used to be called the Dye-Stick Meadow, but a lot of the felt land is gone now. The mask's got to be in there!
