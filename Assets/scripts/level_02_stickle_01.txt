P: Hey, it's me, Stickle! Your friend!
P: You did a great job back there!
M: Thanks a lot! What are you doing in the Woolly Jungle? Are you on a journey too?
P: Of course! I want to try and help you find all the masks to save our world.
P: I did find a map saying there's one around here somewhere.
P: But even when you've got it, it can be pretty hard to get around all these yarn trees.
P: Everything's so high up, even for someone who can jump and climb like you...
M: Don't worry. With the Masks of Creativity, there's got to be a way up there.
