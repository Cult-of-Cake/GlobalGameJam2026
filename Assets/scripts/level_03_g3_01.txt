M: Hello? Mask Guardian...?
G3: I am Douppion of the Silk Rivers.
M: Oh, uh -- hi! I'm Merino!
G3: Merino the Feltweaver... I see. You have two other Masks of Creativity, and now you need mine.
M: I've been fighting off enemies and fixing up Craftskan, but I need to be able to do the same here.
M: If I can cross the silk waters, and maybe even the hot glue lava in the volcanoes up ahead, maybe I can save Craftskan.
G3: Weaving the fibres of the world back together... That is what we exist to do.
G3: I will grant you the Yarn Jelly Mask. Use it to swim and pass the waters that stand in your way.
M: Oh! Thank you! I won't be long!
