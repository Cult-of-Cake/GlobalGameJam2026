G2: Who seeks Intarsia of the Woolly Jungle?
G2: Oh, a Feltweaver... You have Crewel's mask?
M: Yes, I'm trying to save Craftskan. And I can't make it through the whole roll of land and save everything without the Masks of Creativity.
G2: You'll need to be a little creative yourself too, you know.
G2: For instance, if you think something is too high to reach... just find another way to get there.
M: Like another path?
G2: Yes. Or a way to do what you couldn't do before.
G2: Crewel trusted you, so... Try this, the Bag Bird Mask. I expect you to reach greater heights with this.
G2: But know this: in my weakened state, this mask will only allow you to jump thrice, not fly forever.
